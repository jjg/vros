Cyberspace is a generic term for non-physical spaces, typically created using electronic communications systems.

A cyberdeck is a specialized piece of computer hardware that provides the physical interface between a person and cyberspace.

The cyberdecks' combination of hardware and software renders a virtual world described by data stored within the cyberdexk itself or as data received from nodesattached to network.

The objects in this environment are created by users directly via the cyberdeck software, VROS. These objects can be created and persisted within the cyberdeck itself (local node), inside a remode node or within a Netspace of nodes where they are managed by the VNS. 

Netspace is a generic term for the cyberspace that contains a network of nodes, akin to what Gibson called "The Matrix".

Virtual Node Service or VNS (pronounced "venus"), are servers that provide a netspace around nodes on a network.  VNS servers catalog node attributes (names, addresses, etc.) and metadata and provide a shared navigatable space around groups of network nodes.  VNS provides the "outside" netspace around groups of network nodes and are responsible for communicating the position of netizens to eachother within this space.
