Cyberspaxe is a generic term for non-physical spaces, typically created using electronic communications systems.

A cyberdeck is a specialized piece of computer hardware that provides the physical interface between a person and the cyberspace contained within the cyberdeck and the network it is attached to.

The cyberdecks combination of hardware and software renders the virtual world described by data stored within the cyberdexk itself as well as data recived from nodes on any attached network.  This renderinf js conveyed to the user as an immersive virtual environment that they can interaxt with using an assortment of inout devices.

The objects in this environment are created by users directly via the cyberdeck software, VROS. These objects can be created and persisted within the cyberdeck itself (the local node), inside a remode node or within a Netspace of nodes where they are managed by the VNS. 

Netspace is a generic term for the cyberspace that contains a network of nodes, akin to what Gibson called "The Matrix".

VNS (pronounced "venus"), Virtual Node Service are servers that provide a netspace for nodes on a network.  VNS servers catalog node attributes (names, addresses, etc.) and metadata and provide a shared navigatable space around groups of network nodes.  VNS provides the "outside" netspace around groups of network nodes and are responsible for communicating the position of netizens to eachother within this space.
